    <h1>Welcome to Anuj’s Free Stock Image Website</h1>
    <strong>Student ID:</strong> 35450857

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a cloud-hosted website offering free, royalty-free stock images that users can search using tags.
        It provides a simple platform where anyone—especially students, bloggers, or developers—can find visuals for use in projects
        without worrying about licensing fees. The search system is based on tags, which will eventually make browsing more intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site is deployed on a DigitalOcean Ubuntu Linux server (IaaS). Nginx is configured as the web server, a custom domain is registered and pointed to the static IP,
        and HTTPS security is implemented using Let’s Encrypt Certbot. This setup demonstrates DNS, SSL/TLS, and basic server administration skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project demonstrates the independent deployment of a virtual server, configuring DNS, securing the website, and hosting web content using Linux and open-source tools.
        Tasks were performed via SSH, providing valuable experience in Linux terminal navigation and server management.
    </p>
    <p>
        The future goal is to add a database for image storage, enable user uploads, and build filtering based on multiple tags, showcasing both system setup and web development skills.
    </p>
