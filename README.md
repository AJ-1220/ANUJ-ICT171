# ANUJ-ICT171
Resourses of my ICT 171 Assignment 

Hey, this is the repo for my ICT171 assignment.
Its a cloud stock image website I made for uni, where people can look for and use free pics without worryin about copyright or anything. The site’s live at:
https://anuj.fun

All the source code is here, like the main HTML (index.html), the bash scripts I used for setting up and backups, and the README for help.
Scripts is commented so if you wanna try it, you can kinda follow along without getting too lost.

If you wanna see the site and how I did it, here’s my video demo for the project:

Made by Anuj Mahato (35450857) for Murdoch Uni.
If you have any probs or wanna ask anything, just let me know. Cheers!
